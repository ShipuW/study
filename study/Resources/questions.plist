		<string>It cannot be assumed that people who dislike some of the physical concomitants of growing old necessarily have negative feelings toward the elderly.</string>
		<key>option2</key>
		<string>To dislike some of the physical concomitants growing old is reasonable, while to dislike the elderly is immoral.</string>
		<key>option3</key>
		<string>Since no one likes the physical concomitants of growing old, it is wrong to dislike the elderly merely because of their physical characteristics.</string>
		<key>option4</key>
		<string>Being elderly is fine, but the process of becoming elderly is not; and people need to understand the distinction between the two.</string>
		<key>option5</key>
		<string>To dislike the elderly is immoral, and to do so just because one dislikes some of the physical concomitants of growing old is unreasonable.</string>
		<key>question</key>
		<string>Can any research be found to validate the contention that those who spend time plucking out their gray hairs have more negative attitudes toward the elderly than those who shrug their shoulders about their gray hairs? Unless a person&apos;s psychopathology leads him or her to overgeneralize, there is no necessary connection. Certainly it is reasonable to like the elderly yet dislike the idea of impaired eyesight and hearing. Furthermore, holding negative attitudes toward older people merely because they are old is immoral, according to nearly universally accepted ethical standards. But there is nothing immoral about disliking some concomitants of the aging process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one of the following best expresses the main point of the passage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<string>Because bald eagles symbolize freedom, conservation efforts should be concentrated on them rather than on other, more obscure species.</string>
		<key>option2</key>
		<string>The conservation of bald eagles is the first necessary step in conserving other endangered species.</string>
		<key>option3</key>
		<string>Without increased public sympathy for conservation, the needs of many symbolic species will go unmet.</string>
		<key>option4</key>
		<string>People&apos;s love of the wilderness can be used to engender political support for conservation efforts.</string>
		<key>option5</key>
		<string>Other threatened species do not inspire people or foster sympathy as much as do bald eagles.</string>
		<key>question</key>
		<string>As symbols of the freedom of the wilderness, bald eagles have the unique capacity to inspire people and foster in them a sympathetic attitude toward the needs of other threatened species. Clearly, without that sympathy and the political will it engenders, the needs of more obscure species will go unmet. The conservation needs of many obscure species can only be met by beginning with the conservation of this symbolic species, the bald eagle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one of the following is the main point of the passage as a whole?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<string>Corn is not a cost effective product and substitutes should be found where possible.</string>

		<string>A layer of topsoil only six to eight inches thick cannot support the continued cultivation of corn.</string>

		<string>Soil conservation is a responsibility of the federal government, not the states.</string>
		<key>option4</key>
		<string>The federal government&apos;s expenditures for soil conservation in the various states have been inequitable.</string>
		<key>option5</key>
		<string>The federal government should spend much more on soil conservation than it has been spending.</string>
		<key>question</key>
		<string>The United States government generally tries to protect valuable natural resources. But one resource has been ignored for too long. In the United States, each bushel of corn produced might result in the loss of as much as two bushels of topsoil. Moreover, in the last 100 years, the topsoil in many states, which once was about fourteen inches thick, has been eroded to only six or eight inches. Nonetheless, federal expenditures for nationwide soil conservation programs have remained at ridiculously low levels. Total federal expenditures for nationwide soil conservation programs have been less than the allocations of some individual states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one of the following best expresses the main point of the argument?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<string>A law that is not consistently enforced does not serve its purpose. Law without enforcement is not law; it is merely statute a promise of law. To institute real law is not merely to declare that such and such behavior is forbidden; it is also to punish those who violate that edict. Furthermore, those who enforce law must punish without favor for their friends or malice for their enemies. To punish only those one dislikes while forgiving others is not to enforce law but to engage in the arbitrary and unjust exercise of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main point of the passage is that instituting real law consists in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<string>There is no mystery as to why figurative painting revived in the late 1970s. People want to look at recognizable images. Sorting out art theories reflected in abstract paintings is no substitute for the sense of empathy that comes from looking at a realistic painting of a figure in a landscape. Perhaps members of the art viewing public resented abstract art because they felt that its lack of realistic subject matter was a rejection of the viewers and their world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<string>Evidence for the existence of trade between Europe and East Asia in the early Middle Ages is, like evidence for the existence of the yeti, not scientifically confirmed.</string>

		<key>question</key>
		<string>Some legislators refuse to commit public funds for new scientific research if they cannot be assured that the research will contribute to the public welfare. Such a position ignores the lessons of experience. Many important contributions to the public welfare that resulted from scientific research were never predicted as potential outcomes of that research. Suppose that a scientist in the early twentieth century had applied for public funds to study molds: who would have predicted that such research would lead to the discovery of antibiotics   one of the greatest contributions ever made to the public welfare?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the argument?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<string>Balanced reporting presents the public with a picture of the world in which all sides to a conflict have equal justification.</string>
		<key>option2</key>
		<string>Balanced reporting requires impartially revealing injustices where they occur no less than fairly presenting the views of each party in a conflict.</string>
		<key>option3</key>
		<string>Our experience of life shows that there are indeed cases in which conflicts arise because of an injustice, with one party clearly in the wrong.</string>
		<key>option4</key>
		<string>Common sense tells us that balance is especially needed when reporting the background of civil wars and conflicts.</string>
		<key>option5</key>
		<string>Balanced reporting is an ideal that cannot be realized, because judgments of balance are necessarily subjective.</string>
		<key>question</key>
		<string>Balance is particularly important when reporting the background of civil wars and conflicts. Facts must not be deliberately manipulated to show one party in a favorable light, and the views of each side should be fairly represented. This concept of balance, however, does not justify concealing or glossing over basic injustices in an effort to be even handed. If all the media were to adopt such a perverse interpretation of balanced reporting, the public would be given a picture of a world where each party in every conflict had an equal measure of justice on its side, contrary to our experience of life and, indeed, our common sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one of the following best expresses the main point of the argument?</string>

		<string>the government needs to refine its methods of detecting toxic substances in our food supply.</string>
		<key>question</key>
		<string>Would it be right for the government to abandon efforts to determine at what levels to allow toxic substances in our food supply? Only if it can reasonably be argued that the only acceptable level of toxic substances in food is zero. However, virtually all foods contain perfectly natural substances that are toxic but cause no harm because they do not occur in food in toxic concentrations. Furthermore, we can never be certain of having reduced the concentration of any substance to zero: all we can ever know is that it has been reduced to below the threshold of detection of current analytical methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main conclusion of the argument is that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<string>That long term cigarette smoking can lead to health problems including cancer and lung disease is a scientifically well established fact. Contrary to what many people seem to believe, however, it is not necessary to deny this fact in order to reject the view that tobacco companies should be held either morally or legally responsible for the poor health of smokers. After all, excessive consumption of candy undeniably leads to such health problems as tooth decay, but no one seriously believes that candy eaters who get cavities should be able to sue candy manufacturers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main point of the argument is that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

Increasing the number of electric cars on the road would require building more generating facilities since current facilities are operating at maximum capacity.

		<string>A report on the likely effects of current levels of air pollution on forest growth in North America concluded that, since nitrogen is a necessary nutrient for optimal plant growth, the nitrogen deposited on forest soil as a result of air pollution probably benefits eastern forests. However, European soil scientists have found that in forests saturated with sulfate and nitrate, trees begin to die when the nitrogen deposited exceeds the amount of nitrogen absorbed by the forest system. Since this finding is likely to apply to forests everywhere, large areas of eastern forests of North America are, undoubtedly, already being affected adversely.&lt;br /&gt;Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<string>When politicians resort to personal attacks, many editorialists criticize these attacks but most voters pay them scant attention.  Everyone knows such attacks will end after election day, and politicians can be excused for mudslinging.  Political commentators, however, cannot be.  Political commentators should be engaged in sustained and serious debate about ideas and policies.  In such a context, personal attacks on opponents serve not to beat those opponents but to cut off the debate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one of the following most accurately states the main point of the argument?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<key>option5</key>
		<string>many board members are remunerated generously and wish to protect this source of income by pleasing the executives to whom they owe their appointments on the board.</string>
		<key>question</key>
		<string>In most corporations the salaries of executives are set by a group from the corporation&apos;s board of directors.  Since the board&apos;s primary mission is to safeguard the economic health of the corporation rather than to make its executives rich, this way of setting executives&apos; salaries is expected to prevent excessively large salaries.  But, clearly, this expectation is based on poor reasoning.  After all, most members of a corporation&apos;s board are themselves executives of some corporation and can expect to benefit from setting generous benchmarks for executives&apos; salaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point made by the author is that the most common way of setting executives&apos; salaries might not keep those salaries in bounds because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

Most bicycles are purchased in the spring, but once shoppers are ready to shop for a bicycle, they usually have already decided which brand and model of bicycle they will purchase.  By then it is generally too late to induce them to change their minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main point of the argument is that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<string>Of every 100 burglar alarms police answer, 99 are false alarms. This situation causes an enormous and dangerous drain on increasingly scarce public resources. Each false alarm wastes an average of 45 minutes of police time. As a result police are consistently taken away from responding to other legitimate calls for service, and a disproportionate share of police service goes to alarm system users, who are mostly businesses and affluent homeowners. However, burglar alarm systems, unlike car alarm systems, are effective in deterring burglaries, so the only acceptable solution is to fine burglar alarm system owners the cost of 45 minutes of police time for each false alarm their systems generate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The statement that burglar alarm systems, unlike car alarm systems, are effective in deterring burglaries plays which one of the following roles in the argument?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

There must therefore be some other explanation for the honeybees&apos; dance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winifred:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not necessarily.

		<string>The stable functioning of a society depends upon the relatively long-term stability of the goals of its citizens. This is clear from the fact that unless the majority of individuals have a predictable and enduring set of aspirations, it will be impossible for a legislature to craft laws that will augment the satisfaction of the citizenry, and it should be obvious that a society is stable only if its laws tend to increase the happiness of its citizens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim that a society is stable only if its laws tend to increase the happiness of its citizens plays which one of the following roles in the argument?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<string>It is a hypothesis that is taken by the scientists to be conclusively proven by the findings described in the passage.</string>
		<key>option2</key>
		<string>It is a generalization that, if true, rules out the possibility that some people who do not take penicillin develop bacteria resistant to it.</string>
		<key>option3</key>
		<string>It is a point that, in conjunction with the fact that some patients who do not take penicillin develop penicillin-resistant bacteria, generates the problem that prompted the research described in the passage.</string>
		<key>option4</key>
		<string>It is the tentative conclusion of previous research that appears to be falsified by the scientists&apos; discovery of the mechanism by which bacteria become resistant to mercury poisoning.</string>
		<key>option5</key>
		<string>It is a generalization assumed by the scientists to conclusively prove that the explanation of their problem case must involve reference to the genetic makeup of the penicillin-resistant bacteria.</string>
		<key>question</key>
		<string>Scientists, puzzled about the development of penicillin-resistant bacteria in patients who had not been taking penicillin, believe they have found an explanation.  The relevant group of patients have dental fillings made of mercury-containing amalgam, and the bacteria the patients develop are immune to mercury poisoning.  Scientists have concluded that the genes causing resistance to penicillin are closely bundled on the chromosomes of bacteria with the gene that produces immunity to mercury poisoning.  Exposure to the mercury kills off bacteria that lack the relevant immunity gene, and leaves room for those that possess both the mercury-immunity gene and the penicillin-resistance gene to flourish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one of the following most accurately characterizes the role played in the passage by the unstated assumption that some patients who take penicillin develop bacteria with an immunity to penicillin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<key>option5</key>
		<string>It is offered as evidence for the stated claim that lawbreaking proceeds from either ignorance of the law, or ignorance of the effects of one&apos;s actions, or free choice.</string>
		<key>question</key>
		<string>Legal theorist:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is unreasonable to incarcerate anyone for any other reason than that he or she is a serious threat to the property or lives of other people.  The breaking of a law does not justify incarceration, for lawbreaking proceeds either from ignorance of the law or of the effects of one&apos;s actions, or from the free choice on the part of the lawbreaker.  Obviously mere ignorance cannot justify incarcerating a lawbreaker, and even free choice on the part of the lawbreaker fails to justify incarceration, for free choice proceeds from the desires of an agent, and the desires of an agent are products of genetics and environmental conditioning, neither of which is controlled by the agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim in the first sentence of the passage plays which one of the following roles in the argument?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<string>It weakens the claim that tree-dwelling reptiles were the first kind of reptile to develop the capacity for flight.</string>
		<key>option5</key>
		<string>It corroborates the observation that some mammals without scales, such as bats, developed the capacity to fly.</string>
		<key>question</key>
		<string>Some biologists believe that the capacity for flight first developed in marine reptiles, claiming that feathers are clearly developed from scales.  Other biologists rightly reject this suggestion, pointing out that bats have no scales and that non-marine reptiles also have scales.  Those who believe that flight first developed in tree-dwelling reptiles reject the claim that the limbs of land-dwelling reptiles might have developed into wings.  They insist that it is more likely that tree-dwelling reptiles developed wings to assist their leaps from branch to branch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the passage by the claim that non-marine reptiles have scales?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<string>It is offered in support of the idea that global warming poses a threat to all organisms.</string>
		<key>question</key>
		<string>Seemingly inconsequential changes in sea temperature due to global warming eventually result in declines in fish and seabird populations.  A rise of just two degrees prevents the vertical mixing of seawater from different strata.  This restricts the availability of upwelling nutrients to phytoplankton.  Since zooplankton, which feed upon phytoplankton, feed the rest of the food chain, the declines are inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<key>question</key>
		<string>Some vegetarians have argued that there are two individually sufficient reasons for not eating meat&amp;mdash;one based on health considerations, and the other based on the aversion to living at the expense of other conscious creatures.  But suppose that eating meat were essential to good health for humans.  Then it would be less clear that an aversion to living at the expense of other conscious creatures is enough of a reason to stop eating meat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the supposition that eating meat is essential to good health?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<key>question</key>
		<string>Sociologist:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Some people argue that capital punishment for theft was an essential part of the labor discipline of British capitalism.  Critics of such a view argue that more people were executed for theft in preindustrial England than were executed in England after industrialization.  But such a criticism overlooks the fact that industrialization and capitalism are two very different social phenomena, and that the latter predated the former by several centuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the passage by the point that capitalism and industrialization are distinct?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

		<key>question</key>
		<string>People&apos;s political behavior frequently does not match their rhetoric.  Although many complain about government intervention in their lives, they tend not to reelect inactive politicians.  But a politician&apos;s activity consists largely in the passage of laws whose enforcement affects voters&apos; lives.  Thus, voters often reelect politicians whose behavior they resent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the claim that people tend not to reelect inactive politicians?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</string>

		<key>question</key>
		<string>The media now devote more coverage to crime than they did ten years ago.  Yet this is not because the crime rate has increased, but rather because the public is now more interested in reading and hearing about crime.  After all, a crucial factor in the media&apos;s decisions about what issues to cover and to what extent to cover them is the interests of their audiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proposition that the public is now more interested in reading and hearing about crime plays which one of the following roles in the argument?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>
